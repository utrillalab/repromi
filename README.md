# Regulation based Proteome Minimization (ReProMin)

Three files are needed for the analysis:

1. A Trasncriptional Regulatory Network file with the information in columns with this format : Regulator - Target - Interaction
2. List of essential genes (Gene nomenclature should match TRN nomenclature)
3. Proteomic information of genes (Proteomic Load) calculated as described in Lastiri-Pancardo et al. (2020)

An example Jupyter Notebook is provided with the analysis performed in the mentioned publication.
